npm install node-red-contrib-hal2
```

## What is it?
**node-red-contrib-hal2** is a set of Node-RED nodes useful for creating home automation flows. The basic component is the Thing node, a virtual representation of a (usually) physical IoT device. This can then be used to trigger events, route traffic based on rules and more.

1. Store a device state in a **Thing node**
2. Fire an event when the value changes using an **Event node**
3. One or more rules will compare the value and that of other Items in a **Gate node**
4. Output the value to another flow with a **Value node**
5. Send device commands to multiple Things using an **Action node**

The documentation is somewhat lacking at the moment, but take a look at the example flows and Thing definitions in the https://github.com/flic/node-red-contrib-hal2/tree/main/examples folder for more information.
